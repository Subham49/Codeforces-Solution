# 🚀 Game 23

**Problem Link**: [1141A - Game 23](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/114/A)

## 🧩 Problem Description

Polycarp plays **"Game 23"**. Initially, he has a number `n` and his goal is to transform it to `m`.

In one move, he can:
- Multiply `n` by **2**, or
- Multiply `n` by **3**

He can perform any number of such moves.

The task is to determine the **minimum number of moves** required to convert `n` into `m`. If it's **not possible**, output `-1`.

## ✅ Input

A single line containing two integers `n` and `m`  
(1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 5 × 10⁸)


## 🎯 Output

Print the number of moves to transform `n` to `m`, or `-1` if it is not possible.


## 💡 Examples

Input: 120 51840  
Output: 7  

Input: 42 42  
Output: 0  

Input: 48 72  
Output: -1

## 🧠 Solution Approach

- If `m` is **not divisible** by `n`, it is impossible to reach `m` from `n` using only multiplications by 2 or 3.
- Otherwise, compute `temp = m / n`.
- Count how many times `temp` can be divided by 2 and 3.
- If after dividing out all 2s and 3s from `temp`, you are left with 1, then the transformation is possible.
- The **number of moves** is the total number of times you divide by 2 or 3.


## 💻 Java Implementation

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Game23 {

    public static final void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int m = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(fun(n, m));
        sc.close();
    }

    public static int fun(int n, int m) {
        int ans = 0;
        if (m % n != 0) return -1;

        int temp = m / n;
        while (temp != 1) {
            if (temp % 3 == 0) {
                temp /= 3;
            } else if (temp % 2 == 0) {
                temp /= 2;
            } else {
                return -1;
            }
            ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
